  ## Installation
  
  To install, begin by cloning the code into a desired location on the user's PC. Using command line, navigate into the root. From there, type 'npm start' and return/enter. The app will start. In order to actually see that the server is working, using a 3rd-party app such as Insomnia we can see the server routes at work.
      
  ## Usage
  
  Depending on what the user would like to do, certain endpoints can perform CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) on any of the tables in the database, specifically Categories, Products and Tags. (There is a fourth ProductTag table, but it serves only to connect the Product and Tag tables.)
